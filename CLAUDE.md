# CLAUDE.md — Personal Semantic Layer (PSL/i) marketing site

You are building the **Personal Semantic Layer (PSL/i)** marketing website. Read this file every session. Full detail: `Sable_Website_Design_Brief.md`.

> **Naming update (2026‑07‑04):** the product working name is now **Personal Semantic Layer (PSL/i)** (short form **PSL/i**), replacing the former name *Sable*. Older parts of the brief may still say “Sable” — treat those as “PSL/i”.

## Brand & naming (strict)
- Product = **Personal Semantic Layer (PSL/i)**. Company/brand = **PSL**. Footer/legal: “**Personal Semantic Layer (PSL/i), by PSL**”.
- Use the **full name on the first/prominent mention** of a page, then the short form **PSL/i** for the logo and repeat mentions.
- The **hero stays outcome‑led** — keep the headline “An AI that actually knows you.” Introduce the name in the eyebrow, not the headline. Don’t turn the headline into an architecture phrase.

## What PSL/i is (one line)
An AI that actually knows you — it resolves what your life and work mean once, holds it privately, and reuses it across your apps. Navigator (proposes, acts only after you approve) · Foundation (private store of resolved meaning, with provenance + audit) · two V1 lenses (Communications, Reasoning) · $100/mo · Cloud + Home‑Server tiers · trust by design.

## Positioning rules
- Lead with the **outcome**, then show the surface, then explain the idea.
- “A packaged product, **not a chatbot**.”
- Sell **memory + trust together**.
- Concrete examples: “What do I owe Jane?”, “Prepare renewal summary”, “Show me at‑risk commitments”.
- ⚠ The `UI_Work_Surface` mockup is the **V3 vision** — use it only on the **Vision** page / as aspirational hero accent. Never present it as the V1 product. V1 = two lenses over existing apps.
- No SOC 2 / HIPAA / compliance badges until real. Legal pages need counsel.

## Approved copy (reuse, swap in *Sable*)
- Problem: “A person is coherent. Their digital life is not.”
- How it works: “One foundation. Resolved once. Used everywhere.”
- Trust tagline / footer: “Your data. Your context. Your decisions.”
- Privacy hero: “Your data was protected before a single line was written.”
- Hero candidates: “An AI that actually knows you.” / “Stop re‑explaining yourself to AI.”
